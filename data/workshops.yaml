  description: "Rope darts as flowtoys are very expressive and versatile props that utilize a mix of spin techniques (think poi), shots, wraps around body parts, contact play (playing with other body parts besides the hands), dance, and potentially acrobatics. Originally, it's one of the soft weapons in Chinese martial arts.\n\nThe workshop is primarily aimed at beginners and will go over fundamental concepts and basic moves. The concrete content will be adapted to what the people there want to learn. If there are people interested in intermediate and advanced techniques just poke me and we can schedule another workshop session or extend this one.\n\nI'll bring 4-6 darts. If you have your own already bring it along please. I'll also bring supplies to DIY darts as necessary (which takes about 15mins). If you don't have a dart yet, ideally hit me up before so we know if we have enough and/or can make more as needed. Any fist-sized, soft weight of around 250g can be used for that purpose, if you want to get creative :)"
