Great! Now I want to combine it all together, the input manager and the menu renderer we extracted.

We will be building a settings menu by creating another program that uses menu renderer. The colour of this one will be green. 

The settings menu will have several settings that can be adjusted by the inputs of the input manager. When we are not in the menu program We want to listen for the click of the input manager And if we find a click we open the settings menu program.

It has these menu items:

Close: Selected by default and closes the settings menu by finishing the program
Workshop Timescale: 1-100 // Speeds up the passing of time for testing purposes
Simulate Date: yes or no // Pretends the burn is happening today instead of using the real date
Brightness: 0-100 // Brightness of the screen
